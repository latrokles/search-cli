# search

very simple tool to perform web searches from the terminal written in node. 
Inspired by [zquestz/s](https://github.com/zquestz/s) (and other cli apps) in 
functionality, but with a different implementation.

a small experimenting learning js and node (and just having fun).

# install
```
npm install search-cli
```

# usage
```
  Usage: search [options] <query>

  Options:

    -h, --help                       output usage information
    -V, --version                    output the version number
    -s, --service <service>          to perform search on (e.g. google, npm)
    -c, --configure                  configure a new service
